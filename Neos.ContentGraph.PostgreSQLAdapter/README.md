# Event Sourced Content Repository - Content Graph PostgreSQL Adapter

### !!! The PostgreSQL Adapter is NOT finalised and NOT working, Please use the doctrine adapter instead.

This means that Neos 9.0.0 does NOT support PostgreSQL - the doctrine adapter is only mariadb compatible.
For progress please see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3855

This repository is a **read-only subsplit** of a package that is part of the [Neos Development Collection](https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection)

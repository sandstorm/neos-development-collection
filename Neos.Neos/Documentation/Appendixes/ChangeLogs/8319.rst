`BUGFIX: Add missing event emitters to internal node properties <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/5343>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Review instructions**

Currently, when using the event log, internal node data is not logged. So whenever an internal property like ``_hiddenBeforeDateTime`` is changed, you can't see that property in the event log. Therefore, this PR adds missing event emitters to the methods used to set the internal properties.

resolved: `#3284 <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3284>`_

`BUGFIX: Force direct access on setting node properties in node data similarize <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/5281>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``creationDateTime`` has no setters in AbstractNodeData, so the NodeData::similarize can't set them in the target node propery. We need to allow the ``ObjectAccess::setProperty`` to force direct access to the class properties.

The ``lastModificationDateTime`` was also not copied before this bugfix and shouldn't be copied anyways.

`BUGFIX: Fixed table view of asset editor <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/5432>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This table view:

<img width="1594" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ff81f3e-477a-42fe-ad77-3074fa0d14ae" />

doesn't currently work because the event listener checks whether there is an <a> or a <button> but doesn't check for <tr>. I fixed it by removing the check completely and using e.currentTarget instead of e.target.

The check was not necessary because the eventlistener was already only added to the elements that meet the criteria.
The use of event.currentTarget ensures that you always use the element that the eventlistener was actually added to, whereas event.target is the element that was clicked, which is not necessary in this case.

Nothing has to be adjusted to use this.

`BUGFIX: Share same role details when adding user as when editing them <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/5206>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When editing users, much more information was shown about the individual roles than when adding a user, where whoever adds them gets no information about the role except its name.

With this change the descriptions of the role and their individual privileges are displayed in the same way as in the edit account view.

also for Neos.ContentRepository.Migration, Neos.Neos.Setup and Neos.Setup

They were simply missing in the list of command identifier which are allowed to render the command reference.

`TASK: Fix MySQL migration differences on fresh setup <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/4236>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This eliminates some differences in the actual vs the expected DB setup in a fresh
Neos 8.3 installation.

* Fixes: `#3118 <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3118>`_ (at least partly.)

**Review instructions**

``doctrine:migrationgenerate`` should just say ``No changes detected`` after Neos has been set up.

`TASK: Allow setting itemsPerPage in user administration listing <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/5325>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Neos 8.3, pagination was added to the user management module, but the number of users page page was not made configurable and set at a very low number of 10. This non-breaking change introduces this as a setting, keeping the default of 10.

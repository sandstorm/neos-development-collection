     * Issuing 'hard' removals via {@see RemoveNodeAggregate} on a non-live workspace ist not desired in Neos
     * and comes with complications:
     *
     * - Hard removals destroy all hierarchy information immediately, making it impossible to locate where a removal took place.
     *   A special case imposes the deletion of newly created nodes.
     *   Associating content changes with its document is important when publishing via {@see WorkspacePublishingService::publishChangesInDocument()}
     *
     * - Hard removals easily cause conflicts:
     *   The removal of a selected node might not be published in that scope if a node was moved outwards.
     *   The rebase will cause conflicts if changes were made in a hierarchy of removed nodes, like moving nodes outwards.
     *
     * Instead, tagging a node / its subtree via {@see TagSubtree} will mark it as removed in Neos.

     * Nodes tagged as removed will not show up in the frontend rendering nor in the backend by default.
     * Only subtracting this removed tag from the {@see VisibilityConstraints} or operating on the node aggregates directly
     * will make soft removed nodes available.

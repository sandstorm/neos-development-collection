Feature: Tests for soft removal garbage collection with impending conflicts caused by subtree tagging

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values                         | Generalizations                         |
      | example    | general, source, special, peer | special->source->general, peer->general |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': {}
    'Neos.Neos:Sites':
      superTypes:
        'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': true
    'Neos.Neos:Document':
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        uriPathSegment:
          type: string
      references:
        myReference:
          constraints:
            nodeTypes:

      superTypes:
        'Neos.Neos:Document': true
    'Neos.Neos:Site':
      superTypes:
        'Neos.Neos:Document': true
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"

    When the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value           |
      | workspaceName      | "live"          |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier" |
    And I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {"example": "source"}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                    |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford" |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.Neos:Sites"        |
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:

      | nodingers-kitten       | nodingers-cat          | Neos.Neos:Document |
    And the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:

      | workspaceName      | "user-workspace" |
      | baseWorkspaceName  | "live"           |

  # TagSubtree / DisableNodeAggregate conflict prevention; especially also for redundant soft removal in the user workspace

    Then I expect the following hard removal conflicts to be impending:

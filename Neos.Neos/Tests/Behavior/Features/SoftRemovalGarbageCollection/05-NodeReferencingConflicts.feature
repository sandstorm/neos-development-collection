Feature: Tests for soft removal garbage collection with impending conflicts caused by node referencing

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values                         | Generalizations                         |
      | example    | general, source, special, peer | special->source->general, peer->general |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': {}
    'Neos.Neos:Sites':
      superTypes:
        'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': true
    'Neos.Neos:Document':
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        uriPathSegment:
          type: string
      references:
        myReference:
          constraints:
            nodeTypes:
              'Neos.Neos:Document': true
    'Neos.Neos:OtherDocument':
      superTypes:
        'Neos.Neos:Document': true
    'Neos.Neos:Site':
      superTypes:
        'Neos.Neos:Document': true
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"

    When the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value           |
      | workspaceName      | "live"          |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier" |
    And I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {"example": "source"}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                    |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford" |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.Neos:Sites"        |
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId        | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeTypeName       |
      | sir-david-nodenborough | lady-eleonode-rootford | Neos.Neos:Site     |
      | nodingers-cat          | sir-david-nodenborough | Neos.Neos:Document |
      | nodingers-kitten       | nodingers-cat          | Neos.Neos:Document |
    And the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value            |
      | workspaceName      | "user-workspace" |
      | baseWorkspaceName  | "live"           |
      | newContentStreamId | "user-cs-id"     |

  Scenario: Garbage collection will ignore a soft removal in dimension if the node has unpublished reference changes in another workspace
    When the command TagSubtree is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                 |

    And I am in workspace "user-workspace"
    And the command SetNodeReferences is executed with payload:
      | Key                       | Value                                                                                    |

      | references                | [{"referenceName": "myReference", "references": [{"target": "sir-david-nodenborough"}]}] |
    And the command RebaseWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key           | Value            |
      | workspaceName | "user-workspace" |
    Then I expect the following hard removal conflicts to be impending:
      | nodeAggregateId | dimensionSpacePoints                            |
      | nodingers-cat   | [{"example": "source"}, {"example": "special"}] |

    When soft removal garbage collection is run for content repository default
    Then I expect exactly 6 events to be published on stream "ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 5 is of type "SubtreeWasTagged" with payload:

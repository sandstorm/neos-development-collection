Feature: Publish nodes partially with dimensions

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values       | Generalizations |
      | language   | de,gsw,fr,en | gsw->de->en, fr |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Node':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |

    And I am in workspace "live"
    And I am in dimension space point {"language": "de"}
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:

      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |

Feature: Discard nodes partially with dimensions

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values       | Generalizations |
      | language   | de,gsw,fr,en | gsw->de->en, fr |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Node':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |

    And I am in workspace "live"
    And I am in dimension space point {"language": "de"}
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |

  Scenario: Discards nodes partially from user workspace with live base workspace
    Given the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value            |
      | workspaceName      | "user-workspace" |

      | newContentStreamId | "user-cs-id"     |
    And I am in workspace "user-workspace"

    Then I am in dimension space point {"language": "de"}
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:

    Then I am in dimension space point {"language": "fr"}
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:

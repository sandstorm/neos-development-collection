Feature: Move dimension space point

  These are the constraint check tests to prevent damage to the content repository state

  Background: Set up the stage
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values          | Generalizations      |
      | language   | mul, de, en, ch | ch->de->mul, en->mul |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': true
          'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:OtherDocument': true

    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:OtherDocument': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value           |
      | workspaceName      | "live"          |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier" |
    And I am in workspace "live"
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    # Node /document
    When the command CreateNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key                       | Value                                     |
      | nodeAggregateId           | "sir-david-nodenborough"                  |
      | nodeTypeName              | "Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document" |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | {"language": "de"}                        |
      | parentNodeAggregateId     | "lady-eleonode-rootford"                  |

  Scenario: Error case - there's already an edge in the target dimension
    When the command MoveDimensionSpacePoint is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key           | Value              |
      | workspaceName | "live"             |
      | source        | {"language": "ch"} |
      | target        | {"language": "de"} |

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "DimensionSpacePointAlreadyExists"

  Scenario: Error case - the target dimension is not configured
    When the command MoveDimensionSpacePoint is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key           | Value              |
      | workspaceName | "live"             |
      | source        | {"language": "de"} |
      | target        | {"language": "notexisting"} |

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "DimensionSpacePointNotFound"

  Scenario: Error case - there are changes in another workspace
    Given the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value                |
      | workspaceName      | "user-test"          |
      | baseWorkspaceName  | "live"               |
      | newContentStreamId | "user-cs-identifier" |
    And the command SetNodeProperties is executed with payload:
      | Key                       | Value                    |
      | workspaceName             | "user-test"              |
      | nodeAggregateId           | "sir-david-nodenborough" |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | {"language": "de"}       |
      | propertyValues            | {"text": "changed"}      |
    When I change the content dimensions in content repository "default" to:
      | Identifier | Values       | Generalizations   |
      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw | gsw->de->mul, en->mul |

    When the command MoveDimensionSpacePoint is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key           | Value              |
      | workspaceName | "live"             |
      | source        | {"language": "ch"} |
      | target        | {"language": "gsw"} |

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "WorkspaceContainsPublishableChanges" with message:
    """
    The following workspaces still contain changes: user-test
    """

  Scenario: Error case - adjusting workspace that is non-root or not immediately based on root
    This limitation is required as we validate that all workspaces except the current on is empty.
    For publishing we store the originally attempted workspace in $initialWorkspaceName as during the
    publication this workspace is allowed to contain changes. Allowing to publish adjustments through multiple workspace
    complicates things and is not desired, as they are rare fundamental changes that should be run on root or in a migration
    (sandbox) workspace which is published to root.

    Given the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value                |
      | workspaceName      | "shared"          |
      | baseWorkspaceName  | "live"               |
      | newContentStreamId | "shared-cs-identifier" |

    Given the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value                |
      | workspaceName      | "user-test"          |
      | baseWorkspaceName  | "shared"               |
      | newContentStreamId | "user-cs-identifier" |

    When I change the content dimensions in content repository "default" to:
      | Identifier | Values      | Generalizations  |
      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw | gsw->de->mul, en->mul |

    When the command MoveDimensionSpacePoint is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:

      | workspaceName | "user-test"         |
      | source        | {"language": "ch"}  |
      | target        | {"language": "gsw"} |

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "InvalidDimensionAdjustmentTargetWorkspace"

  Scenario: Error case - the move violates the projected fallbacks which have to be resolved (replaced by variants) first.
    Given the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId                  | nodeTypeName                            | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeName                     | originDimensionSpacePoint |

      | nody-mc-nodeface                 | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | varied-nodenborough    | child-document               | {"language": "de"}        |
    And the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                 |
      | nodeAggregateId | "varied-nodenborough" |
      | sourceOrigin    | {"language":"de"}     |
      | targetOrigin    | {"language":"ch"}     |
    And the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                      |
      | nodeAggregateId              | "only-source-nodenborough" |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {"language":"ch"}          |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allSpecializations"       |

    When I change the content dimensions in content repository "default" to:
      | Identifier | Values           | Generalizations            |
      | language   | mul, en, ch, gsw | ch->mul, gsw->mul, en->mul |

    When the command MoveDimensionSpacePoint is executed with payload and exceptions are caught:
      | Key           | Value              |
      | workspaceName | "live"             |
      | source        | {"language": "de"} |
      | target        | {"language": "gsw"} |

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "NodeAggregateDoesCurrentlyNotOccupyDimensionSpacePoint"

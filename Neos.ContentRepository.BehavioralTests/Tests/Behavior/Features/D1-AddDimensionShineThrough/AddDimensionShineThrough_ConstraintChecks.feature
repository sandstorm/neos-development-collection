Feature: Add Dimension Specialization - constraint checks

  This is needed if "de" exists, and you want to create a "de_CH" specialization:
  - there, you want to create EDGES for de_CH, without materializing NODES (so that the shine-through works as expected)

  !! Constraint: the Target Dimension Space should be empty.

    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values      | Generalizations |
      | language   | mul, de, en | de->mul         |

  Scenario: Error case - there's already an edge in the target dimension in another workspace, e.g. by executing the same command
    Given the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:

  Scenario: Error case - adjusting workspace that is non-root or not immediately based on root
  This limitation is required as we validate that all workspaces except the current on is empty.
  For publishing we store the originally attempted workspace in $initialWorkspaceName as during the
  publication this workspace is allowed to contain changes. Allowing to publish adjustments through multiple workspace
  complicates things and is not desired, as they are rare fundamental changes that should be run on root or in a migration
  (sandbox) workspace which is published to root.

    Given the command CreateWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value                  |

      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw | gsw->de->mul |

Feature: Update root node aggregate dimension space point

  These are the constraint check tests to prevent damage to the content repository state

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values | Generalizations |
      | language   | fr, de |                 |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document: {}
    Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Root:
      superTypes:
        Neos.ContentRepository:Root: true

        tethered:

    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:

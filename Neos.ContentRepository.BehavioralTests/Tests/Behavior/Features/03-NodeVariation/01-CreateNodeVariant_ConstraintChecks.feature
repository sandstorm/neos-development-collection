Feature: Create node variant

  As a user of the CR I want to create a copy of a node within an aggregate to another dimension space point.

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values  | Generalizations |
      | market     | DE, CH  | CH->DE          |
      | language   | de, gsw | gsw->de         |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      childNodes:
        tethered:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:RestrictiveDocument':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': false
      childNodes:
        tethered:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered'
          constraints:
            nodeTypes:
              'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': false
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value           |

      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    # We have to add another node since root nodes have no dimension space points and thus cannot be varied
    # Node /document
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId        | nodeName | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeTypeName                            | tetheredDescendantNodeAggregateIds |

    # We have to add yet another node since we need test cases with a partially covering parent node
    # Node /document/child
      | nody-mc-nodeface       | child    | sir-david-nodenborough | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | {}                                 |
    And I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"de"}
    # We have to add yet another node that could be varied but not to a different parent
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId      | nodeName       | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeTypeName                            |
      | polyglot-mc-nodeface | polyglot-child | lady-eleonode-rootford | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document |

/**
 * The CommandSimulator is used during the publishing process, for partial publishing and workspace rebasing.
 *
 * For this case, we want to apply commands including their constraint checks step by step, to see whether this
 * set of commands applies cleanly without errors, and which events would be created by them, but we do NOT
 * want to commit the updated projections or events.
 *
 * Internally, we do the following:
 * - Create a database transaction in the GraphProjection which we will roll back lateron (to dry-run
 * projection updates) (via {@see CommandSimulator::run()}).
 * - Create an InMemoryEventStore which buffers created events by command handlers.
 * - execute all commands via {@see CommandSimulator::handle()}
 * - -> this will do all constraint checks based on the projection in the open transaction (so it sees
 * previously modified projection state which is not committed)
 * - -> it will run the command handlers, buffer all emitted events in the InMemoryEventStore
 *   -> note to avoid full recursion the workspace command handler is not included in the bus
 * - -> update the GraphProjection, but WITHOUT committing the transaction {@see ContentGraphProjectionInterface::inSimulation()}
 *
 * This is quite performant because we do not need to fork a new content stream.
 *

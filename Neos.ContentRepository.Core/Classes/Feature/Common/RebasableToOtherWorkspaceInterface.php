 * For complex commands a serialized counterpart - which is not api - will be build which implements this interface.
 *
 * During a rebase, the command (either the original {@see CommandInterface} or its serialized counterpart) will be deserialized
 * from array {@see SerializedCommandInterface::fromArray()} and reapplied via the {@see CommandSimulator}

 * Reminder: a rebase can fail, because the target content stream might contain conflicting changes.

/**
 * Thrown if the subscribers could not be catchup without encountering errors.
 *
 * Still, as we collect the errors and don't halt the process the system will be still up-to-date as far as possible.
 *
 * Following reasons would trigger this error:
 *
 * - A projection has a failure in its code. Then the projection is rolled back to the last event and put into ERROR state.
 *   An exception will be part of this collection indicating this change. Further catchup's will not attempt to update that
 *   projection again, as it has to be fixed and reactivated first.
 *
 * - A catchup hook contains an error. In this case the projections is further updated and also all further catchup errors
 *   collected. This results in a {@see CatchUpHookFailed} exception.

### Translate and document

You can contribute to the translation process, by creating an account at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/neos).

On a regularly basis we synchronize the translation from Crowdin to our Git repositories (internally XLIFF is used for storing translations). See the [description of the translation process](https://www.neos.io/contribute/translating-neos.html) on our website for details.

### Support the Neos Project development with bounties

The Neos project is in the process of founding a legal body. Until then it is not possible to directly donate to the Neos project. For the time being Sandstorm Media has therefore agreed with the Neos team to sell Neos supporter badges and use all revenues to support the Neos project. [Check our donations page](https://www.neos.io/contribute/donating-to-neos.html)

## Details on development and testing

**For (specific) Notes on Neos 9, see further downâ€¦**

If you want to contribute to Neos and want to set up a development environment, then follow these steps:

```shell
composer create-project neos/neos-development-distribution neos-development 8.3.x-dev --keep-vcs
```

Note the **-distribution** repository you create a project from, instead of just checking out this repository.

If you need a different branch, you can either use it from the start (replace the ``8.3.x-dev`` by ``9.0.x-dev`` or whatever you need), or switch after checkout (just make sure to run composer update afterwards to get matching dependencies installed.) In a nutshell, to switch the branch you intend to work on, run:

```shell
git checkout 9.0 && composer update
```

The code of the CMS can then be found inside `Packages/Neos`, which itself is the neos-development-collection Git repository. You commit changes and create pull requests from this repository.

- To commit changes to Neos switch into the `Neos` directory (`cd Packages/Neos`) and do all Git-related work (`git add .`, `git commit`, etc) there.
- If you want to contribute to the Neos UI, please take a look at the explanations at https://github.com/neos/neos-ui#contributing on how to work with that.
- If you want to contribute to the Flow Framework, you find that inside the `Packages/Framework` folder. See https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection

In the root directory of the development distribution, you can do the following things:

To run tests, run `composer run test-unit` for unit tests or `composer test-functional` for functional/integration tests.

---

**Note**

We use an upmerging strategy: create all bugfixes to the lowest maintained branch that contains the issue. Typically, this is the second last LTS release - see the diagram at https://www.neos.io/features/release-process.html.

For new features, pull requests should be made against the branch for the next minor version (named like `x.y`). Breaking changes must only go into the branch for the next major version.

### Neos 9


#### Prerequisites

- You need PHP 8.2 installed.
- Please be sure to run off the Neos development distribution in branch 9.0, to avoid dependency issues.

#### Setup

The Event-Sourced Content Repository has a Docker Compose file included in `Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests` which starts both Mariadb and Postgres in compatible versions. Additionally, there exists a helper to change the configuration in your distribution (`/Configuration`) to the correct values matching this database.

Do the following for setting up everything:

1. Start the databases:

   ```shell
   pushd Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests; docker compose up -d; popd

   # to stop the databases:
   pushd Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests; docker compose down; popd
   # to stop the databases AND remove the stored data:
   pushd Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests; docker compose down -v; popd
   ```

2. Copy matching Configuration:

   ```shell
   cp -R Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests/DistributionConfigurationTemplate/* Configuration/
   ```

3. Run Doctrine Migrations:

   ```shell
   ./flow doctrine:migrate
   FLOW_CONTEXT=Testing/Postgres ./flow doctrine:migrate
   ```

4. Setup the Content Repository

   ```shell
   ./flow cr:setup
   ```

5. Set up Behat

   ```shell
   cp -R Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests/DistributionBehatTemplate/ Build/Behat
   pushd Build/Behat/
   rm composer.lock
   composer install
   popd
   ```

#### Running the Tests

##### Behavioural tests (Behat)

The normal mode is running PHP locally, but running Mariadb / Postgres in containers (so we know
we use the right versions etc).

```shell
 cd Packages/Neos
 composer test:behavioral
```

Alternatively, if you want to reproduce errors as they happen inside the CI system, but you
develop on Mac OS, you might want to run the Behat tests in a Docker container (= a linux environment)
as well. We have seen cases where they behave differently, i.e. where they run without race
conditions on OSX, but with race conditions in Linux/Docker. Additionally, the Linux/Docker setup
described below also makes it easy to run the race-condition-detector:

```shell
docker compose --project-directory . --file Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests/docker-compose-full.yml build
docker compose --project-directory . --file Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests/docker-compose-full.yml up -d
docker compose --project-directory . --file Packages/Neos/Neos.ContentRepository.BehavioralTests/docker-compose-full.yml run neos /bin/bash

# the following commands now run INSIDE the Neos docker container:
FLOW_CONTEXT=Testing/Behat ../../../../../flow raceConditionTracker:reset

../../../../../bin/behat -c behat.yml.dist

FLOW_CONTEXT=Testing/Behat ../../../../../flow raceConditionTracker:analyzeTrace
```

##### Benchmark tests

For those you need to install `phive` first, see https://phar.io/#Install, and then run

```shell
phive install phpbench
```

to install the needed [PHPBench]([url](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench)) tool.

Then run

```shell
composer run benchmark
```
